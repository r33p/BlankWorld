# BlankWorld

BlankWorld is a small application, a kind of "demo".<br>
My goal is to learn OpenGL (-lGL), do some realtime audio analyse (-lrtaudio), get midi input (-lrtmidi).<br>
At the end I should have a window (-lGLFW) animated with "chatoyants" graphics.<br><br>
All the dev will be done on Debian system, all dependencies should be resolved with simples apt-get.<br>
TODO :<br>
Include libThrust to allow fast and easier maths.
